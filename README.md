# Time-Stamped-Log-Entry-Insertion-Program-with-Duration-Calculation

This program is designed to write an entry into a log file, which can be used to track events or activities over time.
This Log Entry program can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as keeping track of tasks, events, or other activities over time. The resulting log file provides a detailed record of events and can be used to identify patterns or trends that can be useful in decision-making or problem-solving. The program provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to easily add new entries to the log file.


## Working

The Log Entry program is designed to allow users to easily write an entry into a log file.

The program first reads the previous entry from the log file to determine the time difference or duration between the previous entry and the new entry to be added.

The user is then prompted to provide the time of the event, with two options available: either the current time can be used, or the user can provide a specific time for the event. Once the time of the event has been determined, the program calculates the duration between the previous entry and the new entry.

The new log entry is then added to the log file, which includes the index of the entry, the ordinal entry of the month, the time of the event, and the duration or time difference between the previous entry and the new entry.
